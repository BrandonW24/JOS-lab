# Intro
This semester (Spring 2021), I am taking a OS implementation class (CS_444_X001_S2021) https://os2.unexploitable.systems/info.html. For the lab assignments in this class, we are writing an exokernel-style operating systems kernel named JOS, which in many cases has a similar design to [xv6](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2014/xv6.html). 

# Course Description
This course teaches how interals of modern operating systems are working with hardware/software stack. In the course, we will learn fundamental concepts of operating systems by building an operating system by our own hand. In particular, Labs are based on JOS, an educational OS project, and will build it starting from booting (lab1), to virtual memory (lab2), to process (lab3), and finally to multi-tasking (lab4). We will also covers concurrency issues in systems by learning on how to implement locks and other synchronization mechanisms and how to resolve deadlock issues.
